	<h1> Time, Space, and Complexity.</h1>
	<p>
		 The time complexity is the computational complexity  and efficient that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.
	</p>
	<p>
		The space complexity of an algorithm or a data structure is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem <b>Space Complexity</b>as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely and have O(n).
